# Road-Lane-Lines-Detection

This project implements a system for detecting road lane lines in images and video using computer vision techniques. The pipeline includes camera calibration, perspective transformation, thresholding, and lane line detection, making it suitable for applications like autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## Key Features:
- **Camera Calibration:** Corrects lens distortion for accurate lane detection.
- **Thresholding:** Applies advanced image processing techniques to highlight lane lines.
- **Perspective Transformation:** Transforms the road view to a bird's-eye view for better lane line detection.
- **Lane Line Detection:** Identifies and tracks lane lines in the transformed image.
- **Video Processing:** Processes video streams to detect lane lines in real-time.
